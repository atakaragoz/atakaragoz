Hey, my name is Ata and I'm a 5th year at Wash U in the [Complex Memory Lab](https://sites.wustl.edu/complexmemlab/#:~:text=We%20are%20a%20cognitive%20neuroscience,neurocognitive%20aging%20affects%20these%20processes).

I'm a big fan of Python and am trying to write better code with some RSE principles in mind. 

I have also been picking up JavaScript to help with online experiment presentation.

I am working on some projects that will hopefully be public soon, so stay tuned!
